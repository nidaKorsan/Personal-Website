<p>In my second year in CSE, I joined the Robotics and Automation club in my university and as a team, we decided to attend to CanSat Competition which is orginazed by American Astronautical Society and sponsored by U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, NASA and more organizations.</p>

<p>The consept of the competition design-build-launch a space-type system, following the given requirements. This space-type system is called a “<em>CanSat</em>” (short for <strong>Can</strong> <strong>Sat</strong>telite). Every year the mission changes. In the year our team had attended, we were expected to design an auto-gyro/passive helicopter recovery descent control system of a science payload and a container to protect the science payload as it is deployed from the rocket.</p>
